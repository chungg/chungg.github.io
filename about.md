hey, i'm Gordon. i'm a software engineer based in Canada where i attempt to:
write open-source software before being told my code is non-sense; review code
by others by googling said code i don't understand; and reply to queries
regarding my poorly written code by googling afore-metioned code in an
attempt to figure out my beautiful mind.

i'm focused on data and cloud and currently contribute to
[Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz) for Huawei Technologies Canada, previously at
Red Hat, eNovance, and IBM.

off the clock, i can be found employing major league shift tactics at children
rec league baseball games, dancing randomly, or teaching my mom that the button
doesn't work because she's clicking the button in a screenshot and not a real
button.

feel free to follow me above
