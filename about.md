hey, i'm Gordon. i'm a software engineer based in Canada where i attempt to:
write open-source software before being told my code is non-sense; review code
by others by googling said code i don't understand; and reply to queries
regarding my poorly written code by googling afore-metioned code in an
attempt to figure out my beautiful mind.

i'm currently an engineer learning to learn. previously, i worked on
financial data at d1g1t and on the cloud at Huawei, Red Hat, eNovance, and IBM.
i'm currently helping build [Gnocchi](http://gnocchi.xyz), an infinitely
scalable, time-series database.

off the clock, i can be found building LEGO, dancing randomly, or teaching my
mom that the button doesn't work because she's clicking the button in a
screenshot and not a real button.

feel free to follow me above.
